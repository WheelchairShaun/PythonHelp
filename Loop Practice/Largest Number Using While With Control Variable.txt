Use a while loop with a control variable to find the largest number (user can enter as many numbers as they want, -1 is used to stop the entry).

It should look like this:

Enter a number (-1 is used to stop the program): 5
Enter a number (-1 is used to stop the program): 8
Enter a number (-1 is used to stop the program): 1
Enter a number (-1 is used to stop the program): 7
Enter a number (-1 is used to stop the program): 3
Enter a number (-1 is used to stop the program): -1

The largest number is 8
